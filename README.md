Small project that call all the vagrant filesystem function. If called directly by the webserver, vagrant will reserve the port of the webserver, preventing the web server from restarting. And of course, you don't want that. So we use this daemon to call vagrant. Like this, no port is being bound to vagrant/Virtualbox. It will also make it possible in the long run to support NFS shares.
